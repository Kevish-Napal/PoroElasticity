# PoroElasticity

This project simulates the scattering of poroelastic waves by cracks induced through hydraulic fracturing, using Biotâ€™s theory of poroelasticity. The underlying system consists of a multivariate PDE capturing three rock displacement modes (two shear and one compressional) and one fluid displacement mode. The simulation is implemented in FreeFem++, a finite element solver written in C++.

The generated synthetic data has been used to validate a non-destructive testing framework for subsurface crack imaging, as presented in [Pourahmadian & Napal (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999122000675).
